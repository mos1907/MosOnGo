# Mos Protocol 2.8.x via Golang
I have shared the part of the Mos protocol, which is used in broadcast systems and allows your application to communicate with NRCS systems that we call Mos-Gateway or Mos-Device, in Go language in this repository. You can easily integrate this gateway into your MAM, PAM, Video Playout, Graphics, or Prompter systems that you have developed. You can contact me for more detailed information or integration.
