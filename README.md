# MosOnGo
Mos Protocol 2.8.x via Golang
I have written the part in Go language that enables your application to communicate with NRCS systems, which we call Mos-Gateway or Mos-Device, in the Mos protocol used in broadcast systems in this repository. You can easily integrate this gateway into your MAM, PAm, Video Playout, Graphics, or Prompter systems that you have developed. Please feel free to contact me for more detailed information or integration.
